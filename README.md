<h1>Billing System</h1>
This project is a simple retail billing system developed using the <code>Tkinter</code> library in Python. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to generate and manage bills for various items, such as fast foods, fixed lunches, and Chinese dishes. The system allows users to input customer details, select item quantities, calculate the total cost, and apply taxes. Additionally, users can print the bill and clear entries for new transactions. This project is ideal for learning how to implement billing solutions with Python and <code>Tkinter</code>.
